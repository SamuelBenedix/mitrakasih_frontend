            We have a commitment to making sure that each student is
            appropriately supported and cared for. This commitment goes beyond
            the classroom and looks after studentsâ€™ physical and mental
            wellbeing. As a school, we share this responsibility within a
            Community of Care.

            We seek to promote within our students a positive outlook for life,
            and we help them become balanced and successful citizens,
            well-equipped with the ability to think critically and logically
            about the information they access and the decisions they make.
